## Issue Description

When running `npm start` in the project, the application shows the following error:

```
faisalidris@Faisals-MacBook-Pro NB-WindowsAITroubleshooter % npm start
> windows-troubleshooting-companion@1.0.0 start
> electron .
Tray icon not found, using placeholder: Icon is empty
```

## Expected Behavior

The application should start without errors and display the proper tray icon in the system tray.

## Current Behavior

The application starts but shows a warning about the tray icon not being found and uses a placeholder instead.

## Root Cause

The tray icon file is either:
1. Missing from the expected location
2. Not properly referenced in the code
3. Has incorrect file path or format

## Location of Issue

File: `src/tray-app/main.ts`
Around line 71: `const i` (likely related to icon initialization)

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to project directory
2. Run `npm start`
3. Observe the error message in terminal

## Impact

- User experience degraded (placeholder icon instead of proper branding)
- Professional appearance compromised
- May indicate other asset loading issues

## Priority: Medium

This affects the visual presentation but doesn't break core functionality.

## Suggested Fixes

1. Ensure tray icon assets exist in the correct location
2. Verify file paths in the tray initialization code
3. Add proper error handling for missing assets
4. Include fallback icon generation or proper placeholder
