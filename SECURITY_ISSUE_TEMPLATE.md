# Security Fixes Implementation - Issue Template

## Title: Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed in Skills Engine

## Labels: security, bug, critical, enhancement

## Issue Description

Three critical security vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed in the Windows AI Troubleshooter Skills Engine implementation. This issue documents the vulnerabilities, fixes, and verification procedures.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Process Killing Race Condition (HIGH Severity)
**Location:** `src/skills-engine/sandbox.ts` (Lines 229-239)
**CWE-362:** Race Condition
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)

**Problem:** Race condition where process might complete between timeout check and kill operation.

**Fix:** Implemented atomic process state management with proper cleanup.

### 2. Environment Variable Pollution (HIGH Severity)
**Location:** `src/skills-engine/sandbox.ts` (Lines 165-171)
**CWE-402:** Transmission of Private Resources
**CVSS Score:** 8.1 (High)

**Problem:** Direct modification of `process.env` causing parent process environment pollution.

**Fix:** Implemented secure environment isolation with validation and sanitization.

### 3. Resource Monitoring Implementation (HIGH Severity)
**Location:** `src/skills-engine/sandbox.ts` (Lines 279-288)
**CWE-770:** Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)

**Problem:** Empty resource monitoring implementation allowing resource exhaustion attacks.

**Fix:** Implemented comprehensive CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring.

## Files Modified

- `src/skills-engine/sandbox.ts` - Main security fixes
- `src/skills-engine/types.ts` - Enhanced type definitions
- `src/skills-engine/errors.ts` - New error classes
- `src/skills-engine/utils/windows-utils.ts` - Windows-specific resource monitoring

## Security Impact

### Before Fixes:
- Potential process leakage and inconsistent timeout behavior
- Parent process environment pollution and information leakage
- Resource exhaustion attacks possible with no monitoring
- Security bypass opportunities

### After Fixes:
- Atomic process management prevents race conditions
- Complete environment isolation between processes
- Comprehensive resource monitoring and limit enforcement
- Enhanced security event logging and auditing

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Process Race Condition Test
```bash
# Test timeout handling with rapid process creation
npm test -- --testNamePattern="process timeout"
```

### 2. Environment Isolation Test
```bash
# Test environment variable sanitization
npm test -- --testNamePattern="environment isolation"
```

### 3. Resource Monitoring Test
```bash
# Test resource limit enforcement
npm test -- --testNamePattern="resource monitoring"
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Process timeout race condition fixed
- [ ] Environment variable pollution prevented
- [ ] Resource monitoring fully implemented
- [ ] Windows-specific resource monitoring working
- [ ] Security event logging functional
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No performance regression

## Compliance Impact

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized data leakage between processes
- ✅ Enhanced audit logging for data processing activities

### HIPAA Compliance
- ✅ Environment isolation protects sensitive health information
- ✅ Comprehensive security event logging

### SOC2 Compliance
- ✅ Demonstrates security control implementation
- ✅ Provides audit trail for security events

### ISO27001 Compliance
- ✅ Implements proper access controls
- ✅ Provides incident response capabilities

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (if issues detected):
1. Revert commits related to security fixes
2. Restore from backup taken before security implementation
3. Verify system functionality
4. Schedule security re-implementation

### Timeline:
- Critical issues: Immediate rollback within 1 hour
- Minor issues: Scheduled rollback within 24 hours

## Team Communication

### Development Team:
- Review security implementation details
- Understand new security patterns and best practices
- Update development guidelines

### Operations Team:
- Monitor new security event logs
- Set up alerts for resource limit violations
- Update deployment procedures

### Management Team:
- Security risk reduction summary
- Compliance status update
- Resource requirements for ongoing security maintenance

## Future Security Hardening

### Short-term (1-2 weeks):
- [ ] Add fuzz testing for input validation
- [ ] Implement penetration testing scenarios
- [ ] Enhance security documentation

### Medium-term (1-2 months):
- [ ] Add certificate pinning for external communications
