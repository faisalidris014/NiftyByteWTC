## 1) What is a ‚Äúlean PRD‚Äù?  
A **lean PRD (Product Requirements Document)** captures only what‚Äôs necessary to build and ship an MVP that solves the core problem end-to-end. It‚Äôs concise but complete: problem, who it‚Äôs for, the smallest set of features, success metrics, guardrails, and a delivery plan.  

---

## 2) Problem Statement  
Non-technical end-users struggle with IT issues (Wi-Fi, printing, app errors, file recovery). Traditional support requires opening tickets, waiting for IT, or searching KBs they don‚Äôt understand.  

**Pain points:**  
- High ticket volumes overwhelm IT.  
- Users frustrated with delays.  
- Built-in Windows/Mac troubleshooters too limited.  
- No proactive AI that can both *diagnose and act*.  

**Opportunity:**  
A system tray‚Äìbased AI troubleshooting companion that can:  
- Run automated local fixes.  
- Walk users through steps with plain language.  
- Escalate to ITSM if unresolved.  
- Log results for IT visibility.  

---

## 3) Product Goals & Non-Goals  

**Goals (MVP):**  
- Simple, tray-accessible chatbot for end-users.

- ITSM integration (ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk, Freshservice, Salesforce).  
- Admin Console for skill enable/disable, monitoring, and reporting.  

**Non-Goals (MVP):**  
- Full LLM offline model (use small local logic + optional cloud lookups).  
- Full remote desktop control.  
- Deep OS patch management (reserved for roadmap).
