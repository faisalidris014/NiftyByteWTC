# Task 13.0 - UI Enhancements & Tray Improvements

**Assigned Teams:** frontend-dev, product-design

## Subtasks:
- [x] 13.1 Implement tray window docking behavior (frontend-dev)
- [x] 13.2 Auto-align chat window to right screen edge on open (frontend-dev)
- [x] 13.3 Refresh quick-action button styling and states (product-design)
- [x] 13.4 Replace tray icon with official asset and ensure reliable load (frontend-dev)
- [x] 13.5 Add placeholder bot status component for AI message flow (frontend-dev)

## Notes
- Docking UX now anchors to the active display's right edge and adjusts when monitors change.
- Quick-action updates must maintain accessibility contrast ratios on light/dark backgrounds.
- Tray icon work includes packaging the asset for Windows and fallbacks when missing.
- Bot status element should surface loading/queued indicators ahead of full AI integration.

## Dependencies
- Completed Task 12.0 CI/CD updates (ensures new assets/tests covered in pipeline).
- Updated design spec from product team for quick-action and status component visuals.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tray window follows docking logic and reopens in a predictable position.
- Chat window defaults to right edge alignment without visible flicker.
- Quick-action controls display distinct default/hover/active states with WCAG AA contrast.
- Official tray icon appears after install and survives process restarts.
- Bot status component slots into chat layout with stubbed messaging for future AI events.
