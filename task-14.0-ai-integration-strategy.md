# Task 14.0 - AI Integration Strategy

**Assigned Teams:** ai-research, platform-architecture

## Subtasks:
- [x] 14.1 Survey candidate LLM providers with Windows troubleshooting datasets (ai-research)
- [x] 14.2 Assess integration capabilities (APIs, tooling, automation hooks) (platform-architecture)
- [x] 14.3 Evaluate privacy/compliance, latency, and cost implications (platform-architecture)
- [x] 14.4 Document fine-tuning and on-prem deployment options (ai-research)
- [x] 14.5 Produce comparison matrix and top 3 recommendation shortlist (ai-research)
- [x] 14.6 Outline integration steps and prerequisites for selected models (platform-architecture)

## Research Focus
- Providers to evaluate: Azure OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4o, plus any vendor with strong ITSM domain support.
- Required capabilities: ServiceNow/Jira/Slack connectors, retrieval or knowledge base ingestion, observability hooks, rate-limit management, and conversation memory controls.
- Security requirements: tenant isolation, data residency choices, SOC2/ISO attestations, configurable retention windows, and customer consent flows.

## Deliverables
- Written assessment in `docs/ai/strategy.md` (or similar) summarizing findings, tradeoffs, and costs.
- Ranked shortlist (2â€“3 models) with pros/cons and usage scenarios.
- Implementation outline covering prototype milestones, API credentials, testing strategy, and rollout plan.

## Dependencies
- Completion of Task 13.x UI updates to host forthcoming AI UX elements.
- Coordination with legal/compliance for vendor data-processing agreements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Stakeholders can review a concise recommendation matrix with supporting research.
- Implementation steps identify tooling, infrastructure, and timeline for pilot integration.
- Risks and mitigation strategies (latency, costs, privacy) are documented with owners.
