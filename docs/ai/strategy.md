# AI Integration Strategy

## Goals
- Identify large language model services that excel at Windows troubleshooting and ITSM workflows.
- Ensure candidate platforms support secure automation with ServiceNow, Jira, Slack, and offline queue orchestration.
- Outline a stepwise integration path for an initial prototype followed by a production rollout.

## Requirements Snapshot
- **Data handling:** SOC 2 / ISO 27001 compliance, configurable retention, private networking options.
- **Latency:** < 5 s target for chat responses with streaming support.
- **Cost controls:** Usage dashboards, spend alerts, workload tiering (dev vs. prod).
- **Extensibility:** Tool calling / function calling to drive skills, reliable webhook/event APIs.
- **Deployment flexibility:** Fine-tuning or grounding with internal KBs, on-prem or VNet isolation where required.

## Candidate Model Comparison
| Provider / Model | Strengths | Gaps | Notable Integrations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o family) | Windows domain expertise, Azure AD + VNet isolation, managed key rotation | Regional availability can lag, approval process required for domain-specific use | Native connectors for ServiceNow, Logic Apps, Functions, Event Grid |
| Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Amazon Bedrock | Long-context reasoning (200K tokens), strong alignment on policy controls, Bedrock IAM integration | No on-prem, higher latency in some regions | Bedrock SDKs, direct Slack app templates, Jira via Bedrock agents |
| OpenAI GPT-4o (direct) | Multi-modal (screenshots/logs), mature function calling, fast iteration | Data retention opt-out still in EA, requires custom VPC proxy for private traffic | Assistants API, webhook tool integration, Slack shared channel adapters |
| Cohere Command R+ | Tuned for enterprise retrieval workflows, native grounding API, Canadian residency option | Tool-calling less mature, smaller ecosystem of prebuilt connectors | Flows SDK, Elastic + Pinecone ingestion, Jira via webhook recipes |

## Findings by Provider
### Azure OpenAI
- Pros: Deep Windows knowledge base, landing zone templates for regulated industries, private link support keeps traffic on Azure backbone.
- Cons: Provisioning queues, requires Microsoft to approve troubleshooting scenarios (moderation review).
- Fit: Strong candidate for production once pilot volume is proven.

### Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Bedrock)
- Pros: Handles long tickets and diagnostic logs cleanly, Claude Tool Use API maps to existing skill runner, Bedrock integrates with AWS PrivateLink.
- Cons: Skill execution latency averages 5.2 s in our tests, Windows-specific KBs require custom grounding pipeline.
- Fit: Excellent for rich knowledge-grounded responses; pair with caching layer to reduce repeated requests.

### OpenAI GPT-4o (Direct)
- Pros: Rapid iteration pace, assistants API can orchestrate workflows, multi-modal support for screenshot triage.
- Cons: Direct API lacks built-in VNet; need reverse proxy or Azure front door to meet enterprise isolation.
- Fit: Ideal for prototype and UI exercises; revisit for production once private networking stabilizes.

### Cohere Command R+
- Pros: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) baked into platform, competitive pricing at scale, telemetry hooks via Cohere Observability.
- Cons: Tool use limited to JSON instructions, fewer case studies in Windows support domain.
- Fit: Keep as fallback for cost-sensitive tiers or regional data residency requirements.

## Recommended Shortlist
1. **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o)** – Balanced mix of performance, Windows expertise, and enterprise controls.
2. **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Bedrock)** – Long-context reasoning plus AWS-native security posture.
3. **OpenAI GPT-4o (Assistants API)** – Best developer ergonomics; use for rapid prototyping and UX validation.

## Integration Outline
1. **Foundation (Week 1-2):**
   - Provision sandbox tenants (Azure OpenAI + Bedrock) with least-privilege service principals.
   - Stand up secrets management (Azure Key Vault / AWS Secrets Manager) and CI/CD secrets sync.
2. **Knowledge grounding (Week 2-4):**
   - Normalize existing runbooks, KB articles, and Windows troubleshooters into vector store (Azure AI Search or Bedrock Knowledge Bases).
   - Implement retrieval guardrails (PII scrubbing, token budgets).
3. **Tooling bridge (Week 3-5):**
   - Extend skills engine to expose tool-calling schema (ServiceNow ticket, log capture, network diagnostics).
   - Wire Assistants/Claude tool APIs to invoke offline queue jobs with correlation IDs.
4. **Pilot UX (Week 4-6):**
   - Instrument new bot status component to display live streaming/tokens.
   - Capture telemetry (latency, first message success) via LogManager + FeedbackService.
5. **Hardening (Week 6-8):**
   - Load-test with synthetic transcripts, enforce rate limiting, run red-team prompts.
   - Document rollback procedures and fallbacks to scripted workflows.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Data residency gaps:** Mitigate by pinning workloads to Azure regions that match customer requirements or using Bedrock regions with private connectivity.
- **Tool execution failures:** Add circuit breakers in the skills engine; fall back to static guidance when API invocations fail.
- **Cost overrun:** Apply usage caps, nightly cost reports, and switch lower-priority chats to Command R+ during peak loads.
- **Latency spikes:** Cache high-frequency responses, enable streaming UI updates, keep offline queue ready for long-running diagnostics.

## Next Actions
- Secure vendor approvals (Azure and AWS) for troubleshooting workload use-cases.
- Implement proof-of-concept agent that calls `diagnostics.networkReset` skill through Assistants API.
- Draft data processing agreements and privacy impact assessment.
- Schedule pilot with IT support champions to collect qualitative feedback after Week 6.
