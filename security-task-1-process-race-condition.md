# Security Task 1: Fix Process Killing Race Condition

## Critical Security Vulnerability
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `/src/skills-engine/sandbox.ts` (Lines 229-239)

## Issue Description
The current timeout implementation has a race condition where a process might complete between the timeout check and the kill operation, leading to potential security issues and inconsistent behavior.

## Current Problematic Code
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  if (this.process && !this.process.killed) {
    this.recordSecurityEvent(...);
    this.process?.kill('SIGKILL'); // ‚ùå Race condition
    reject(new Error(`Execution timeout after ${this.options.timeoutMs}ms`));
  }
}, this.options.timeoutMs);
```

## Required Fix
Implement atomic process killing with proper state management to prevent race conditions.

## Security Impact
- Potential process leakage
- Inconsistent timeout behavior
- Possible security bypass if processes aren't properly terminated

## Implementation Requirements
1. Use atomic operations for process state checking and killing
2. Implement proper cleanup regardless of process state
3. Add comprehensive error handling for kill operations
4. Ensure security events are recorded accurately

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for race condition scenarios
- Integration tests with various timeout situations
- Stress tests with rapid process creation/killing
